# ZCAonSatelliteData
 The whole idea behind performing ZCA was to make input less redundant, since most of the adjacent pixels of an image have similar values. It decorrelates the features keeping their variance same. On Satellite dataset, after performing mean normalization, a covariance matrix was computed, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) was applied on the covariance matrix to bring out eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the data. Later, to achieve zero-correlation between features, the dataset was projected onto the eigenvectors obtained in the previous step. In the next step, as a part of regularization process, the data were divided by the square-root of eigenvalues (after adding a small constant epsilon, ∈ ). The resultant dataset was utilized for classification on a Stacked Auto encoder. The classification accuracy was observed to be improving as the value of ∈ was modulated in the dataset.
